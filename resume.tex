\begin{rSection}{EXPERIENCE}
\begin{rSubsection}{Software
Development Engineer, Intern -- {\it Seattle, WA}}{June 2019 --- August 2019}{Remitly, Inc - Pricing Team}

\item Implemented API endpoint to fetch history of pricing rules and designed the UI to reference that history, leading to greater ease-of-use and productivity for pricing analysts to set offered exchange rates
\item Implemented dimensioned scrapers that retrieved pricing data from competitor, increasing data processing throughput by 5 times as measured by the number of queries per day from competitor
\item Redesigned the representation of pricing quote to allow for better readabilty of the economics logic behind a quote
\item Developed database that persisted transaction quotes and integrated it within the transaction flow, allowing for after-the-fact access and review of the pricing quotes of processed transactions
