\begin{rSection}{EXPERIENCE}
\begin{rSubsection}{Software
Development Engineer, Intern -- {\it Seattle, WA}}{June 2019 --- August 2019}{Remitly, Inc - Pricing Team}

\item Implemented endpoint to fetch history of pricing rules and developed the accompanying UI to reference that history, leading to greater ease-of-use for analysts to set the offered exchange rates
\item Implemented scrapers that retrieved pricing data from competitor, increasing data processing throughput
\item Developed infastructure that persisted transacted quotes and implemented endpoint to access said database, allowing for after-the-fact access to processed transactions and better readabilty of the economics logic behind a quote
